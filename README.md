card3d
======

* A cloud of index cards is suspended in a 3D space.
* Cards repel each other by default by inverse square law (TODO).
* Cards sharing a keyword are attracted to each other by same law (TODO).
* Cards with explicit connection stay close to each other by spring law (TODO).
* Cards data are currently stored in "config" file (maybe SQL later).

The goal is to navigate through this index card space (mouse/touchscreen),
to enable/disable various forces, causing auto-reorganizing on similarities,
and to add/delete cards rapidly.
